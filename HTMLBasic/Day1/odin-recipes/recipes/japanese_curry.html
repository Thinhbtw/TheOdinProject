    <h1>Japanese Curry</h1>
    <p>Japanese curry is different from Indian or Thai curries. 
        <br>It is more of a brown stew and it can be mild or spicy, depending on your tastes. 
        <br>It can be served over white rice or with udon noodles. 
        <br>This recipe is very flexible; it can easily be made for more or less people.</p>
